Let me know if you want:

Dockerfile
Grafana/Prometheus metrics
Live connection stats API (REST)


Let me know if you'd like it to:

Simulate specific SMPP PDUs like submit_sm or deliver_sm

Print received data in hex

Add response delays to simulate latency

Or log all traffic to a file

Automatic reconnection

Session timeout handling

Per-session logging

 Or prefer I add connection timeout / idle cleanup next?
